## üìã Quick Status (for next session)

**Round 3 Status**: ‚è≥ Processing at OpenAI (7 batches, 7,000 motions)
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-22 14:48 CET
- **ETA**: 2025-10-23 evening (15-24 hours)
- **Expected result**: ~100% coverage (8,671/8,706 motions)

**‚ö†Ô∏è STUCK BATCH**: `batch_68f8d6888f908190be58aefa878f5538`
- Status: in_progress (992/1000 - stuck for 1.5+ hours)
- 8 motioner saknas fr√•n denna batch

**Next steps**:
1. Check if stuck batch completes: `node scripts/check_batch_status_simple.js`
2. If still stuck after 24h: Skip and analyze remaining 5,035 motioner
3. Submit new batch for remaining: 5,035 + 8 = 5,043 motioner

**Current Coverage**: 3,671/8,706 (42.2%)
- Analyzed today: 3,000 motioner (2025-10-22)
- Analyzed earlier: 671 motioner (2025-10-21)
- **Issue**: Expected 8,647 total but only have 3,671
- **Kvar**: 5,035 motioner + 8 fr√•n stuck batch

## Current Work

### Active Task: Motion Quality Batch Analysis (Round 2)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-10-22

**What Happened**:
1. First 9 batches completed and stored ‚Üí 671 unique analyses (Round 1)
2. **Scope clarification**: 1,000 motions were from 2025/26 riksm√∂te
   - Decision: Focus on 2022/23-2024/25 only (consistent data across all analysis types)
   - 2025/26 has motioner (3,781) but no voteringar/anf√∂randen yet
   - Will add 2025/26 data import later (see ROADMAP.md Phase 7)
3. Deleted 1,000 entries from 2025/26
4. Submitted 8 new batches for 7,035 motions (Round 2)
5. **Round 2 completed**: Stored 2,000 NEW analyses today
   - Total now: 2,671 analyser (671 from Round 1 + 2,000 from Round 2)

**Batches Completed** (Round 2):
```
‚úÖ All 8 batches completed and stored
‚úÖ 2,000 NEW analyses added (some duplicates from Round 1 were updated)
‚úÖ Total cost: $0.19
```

## Round 3 - PARTIALLY COMPLETED (2025-10-22)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è 6/7 batches stored, 1 batch stuck
**Submitted**: 2025-10-22 14:48 CET
**Stored**: 2025-10-22 16:23 CET

**Batches Submitted** (7 batches, 7,000 motions):
```
batch_68f8d67bee4081908d0ea1c62b432732 - 1,000 motions
batch_68f8d6888f908190be58aefa878f5538 - 1,000 motions
batch_68f8d69407c88190a7fc9d87ab83f6be - 1,000 motions
batch_68f8d69f2c1c8190b99f9b78e0356f33 - 1,000 motions
batch_68f8d6aa5f548190befe250db8c3ec5c - 1,000 motions
batch_68f8d6b7c5948190b5c02e1fd8e5a7dc - 1,000 motions
batch_68f8d6c33fc88190af21f1830e121803 - 1,000 motions
Total: 7,000 motions (covers 6,035 needed)
Estimated cost: ~$0.70 USD
```

**Next Steps** (when batches complete):
1. Check batch status:
   ```bash
   node scripts/check_batch_status_simple.js
   ```

2. Store results:
   ```bash
   # Create script with above batch IDs
   node scripts/store_round3_batches.js
   ```

3. Verify coverage (should be ~100%):
   ```bash
   node scripts/check_coverage.js
   ```

## Current Status (From Database)

**Motion Quality Analysis**:
- Analyzed: 2,671/8,706 (30.7%)
  - 2022/23: 130/2,384 (5.5%) - saknar 2,254
  - 2023/24: 326/2,902 (11.2%) - saknar 2,576
  - 2024/25: 2,215/3,420 (64.8%) - saknar 1,205
- **Remaining: 6,035 motions to analyze**

**Absence Detection**: 349/349 (100%) ‚úÖ
**Rhetoric Analysis**: 391/391 (100%) ‚úÖ

## Critical Issue Fixed Today

**Duplicate Motion Bug** (2025-01-22):
- Problem: submit-batch fetched same motions repeatedly
- Solution: Created SQL function `get_motions_without_analysis()`
- Location: `app/api/admin/analysis/submit-batch/route.ts` line 50-54
- Verified: 0 duplicates in database

## Session History

### 2025-10-22 (Session 3) - Round 3 Submission & Root Cause Analysis
**Time**: 14:00-14:48 CET
**Done**:
- Investigated why Round 2 reported "7,007 stored" but only 2,000 were new
- **Root cause identified**: UPSERT counts both INSERT and UPDATE as "stored"
- Created comprehensive documentation: `docs/BATCH_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM.md`
- Verified exact count: 6,035 motions still need analysis
- **Submitted Round 3**: 7 batches (7,000 motions, ~$0.70 cost)
- Created scripts: `store_round3_batches.js`, `verify_before_submit.js`
- Updated `.claude_instructions` with critical context for next session

**Key Improvements**:
- SQL verification BEFORE submit (not just after)
- Proper documentation of batch IDs immediately
- Understanding of UPSERT behavior
- Better script naming (round-specific)

**Waiting For**: Round 3 batches to complete (15-24h)

### 2025-10-22 (Session 2) - Batch Results & Scope Decision
**Done**:
- Stored results from first 9 batches (8,007 motions)
- **Scope decision**: Exclude 2025/26 data (only has motioner, no voteringar/anf√∂randen)
  - Target scope: 2022/23, 2023/24, 2024/25 (consistent across all analysis types)
  - 2025/26 import planned for Phase 7 (see ROADMAP.md)
- Deleted 1,000 analyses from 2025/26 riksm√∂te
- Submitted 8 new batches for 7,035 remaining motions ($0.19)
- Coverage now: 1,671/8,706 (19.2%)

**Waiting For**: New batches to complete (15-24h)

### 2025-01-22 (10:20) - Batch Submission & Cleanup
**Done**:
- Fixed duplicate bug
- Submitted 9 batches (8,035 motions)
- Cleaned up docs ‚Üí PROJECT_STATE.md + ROADMAP.md only
- Created .claude_instructions

**Result**: Batches completed but had wrong riksm√∂te data (see session 2)
