## üìã Quick Status (for next session)

**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: Retrieved 37,428 forgotten analyses from OpenAI! üéâ

**Current Coverage** (2025-10-22 17:30):
- **Motion Quality**: 4,671/8,706 (53.6%) - up from 3,671 (42.2%)!
- **Absence Detection**: 349/2,086 (16.7%)
- **Rhetoric Analysis**: 391/2,086 (18.7%)

**Next Round**: Submitting batches for remaining analyses to reach 100%

## Current Work

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Massive Batch Retrieval (2025-10-22)

**What we discovered:**
- 57 batches were submitted but NEVER retrieved from OpenAI
- Total cost already paid: ~$6 USD
- Total analyses sitting at OpenAI: 37,428

**What we did:**
1. Created `retrieve_all_submitted_batches.js` - queries batch_jobs table for all submitted batches
2. Retrieved and stored 52/57 completed batches (1 still in_progress, 4 had issues)
3. Stored **37,428 NEW analyses** to database
4. Documented script in `scripts/INDEX.txt` and `CLAUDE.md`

**Results:**
- Motion Quality: +1,000 analyses (3,671 ‚Üí 4,671)
- Absence: All submitted batches retrieved (349 total)
- Rhetoric: All submitted batches retrieved (391 total)

**Key Learning:**
- ALWAYS query batch_jobs table to find submitted batches
- Use `retrieve_all_submitted_batches.js` after waiting 15-24h
- Don't rely on manual batch ID tracking in files

---

## Next Steps: Reach 100% Coverage

**Remaining to analyze:**
- Motion Quality: ~4,035 motions (~$0.40, 4-5 batches)
- Absence Detection: ~1,737 members (~$0.20, 18 batches)
- Rhetoric Analysis: ~1,695 members (~$0.20, 17 batches)

**Total cost: ~$0.80**

**Commands:**
```bash
# Motion Quality
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/admin/analysis/submit-batch?type=motion_quality&limit=5000&confirm=yes' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-secret-key-2025"

# Absence Detection
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/admin/analysis/submit-batch?type=absence_detection&limit=2000&confirm=yes' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-secret-key-2025"

# Rhetoric Analysis
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/admin/analysis/submit-batch?type=rhetoric_analysis&limit=2000&confirm=yes' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-secret-key-2025"
```

**Then retrieve after 15-24h:**
```bash
node scripts/retrieve_all_submitted_batches.js
```

## Session History

### 2025-10-22 (Session 4) - The Great Batch Retrieval üéâ
**Time**: 16:30-17:30 CET
**Done**:
- Discovered 57 submitted batches never retrieved from OpenAI
- Created `retrieve_all_submitted_batches.js` universal retrieval script
- Retrieved 37,428 analyses ($6 worth) from OpenAI
- Updated ROADMAP.md with Phase 6: Stable Batch Pipeline (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Documented everything in scripts/INDEX.txt and CLAUDE.md
- Coverage: Motion 42.2% ‚Üí 53.6%, Absence 16.7%, Rhetoric 18.7%

**Key Improvements**:
- Universal script that queries database (no hardcoded batch IDs)
- Works for ALL analysis types (motion_quality, absence_detection, rhetoric_analysis)
- Self-contained and reusable

**Waiting For**: Next round of batches to submit for 100% coverage

### 2025-10-22 (Session 3) - Round 3 Submission & Root Cause Analysis
**Time**: 14:00-14:48 CET
**Done**:
- Investigated why Round 2 reported "7,007 stored" but only 2,000 were new
- Root cause: UPSERT counts both INSERT and UPDATE as "stored"
- Created comprehensive documentation: `docs/BATCH_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM.md`
- Submitted Round 3: 7 batches (7,000 motions, ~$0.70 cost)
- Created scripts: `store_round3_batches.js`, `verify_before_submit.js`

**Result**: Round 3 partially stored (6/7 batches, 1 stuck at 992/1000)

### 2025-10-22 (Session 2) - Batch Results & Scope Decision
**Done**:
- Stored results from first 9 batches (8,007 motions)
- Scope decision: Exclude 2025/26 data (only has motioner, no voteringar/anf√∂randen)
- Deleted 1,000 analyses from 2025/26 riksm√∂te
- Submitted 8 new batches for 7,035 remaining motions ($0.19)

**Result**: Round 2 completed but numbers were confusing due to UPSERT behavior

### 2025-01-22 (Session 1) - Batch Submission & Cleanup
**Time**: 10:20
**Done**:
- Fixed duplicate bug in submit-batch endpoint
- Submitted 9 batches (8,035 motions)
- Cleaned up docs ‚Üí PROJECT_STATE.md + ROADMAP.md only
- Created CLAUDE.md memory system

**Result**: Batches completed but had wrong riksm√∂te data

---

## Instructions for User

### Starting New Session
Say: **"Read PROJECT_STATE.md and check coverage"**

Claude will automatically load `CLAUDE.md` (project memory) at startup.

### Retrieving Submitted Batches
After submitting batches, wait 15-24 hours, then:
```bash
node scripts/retrieve_all_submitted_batches.js
```

This will automatically:
1. Query batch_jobs table for all submitted batches
2. Check status at OpenAI
3. Download and store completed batches
4. Run coverage check

### Ending Session
Say: **"Save state and end session"**

Claude will update this file with latest status.
