**GPT-4.1:** Lower quality than GPT-5 Mini for similar price

---

## Final Recommendation

### **üèÜ Use Grok 4 Fast for Production**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Cost:** $3.87 for 12,900 analyses vs $9.93 (Gemini) or $34.44 (Claude)
2. **Speed:** 2.5 seconds vs 13.7 seconds (Gemini) or 21 seconds (GPT-5 Mini)
3. **Quality:** 7.7/10 is good enough for large-scale analysis
4. **Reliability:** Consistent JSON formatting, no major errors in testing

**Quality Mitigation:**
- For critical analyses or reports, manually review a sample
- Consider using Gemini 2.5 Flash for a subset of high-profile politicians
- The cost savings ($31 vs $10k budget) allow for human review time

---

## Cost Projection for Full Dataset

**Dataset:**
- Motion Quality: 8,706 motions
- Absence Detection: 2,086 members
- Rhetoric Analysis: 2,086 members
- **Total:** 12,878 analyses

| Model | Cost | Time (estimated) | Quality | Recommendation |
|-------|------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| **Grok 4 Fast** | **$3.86** | ~9 hours | 7.7/10 | ‚úÖ **Use this** |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $9.92 | ~49 hours | 8.8/10 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Good alternative |
| GPT-5 Mini | $18.67 | ~75 hours | 9.0/10 | ‚ùå Too slow/expensive |
| GPT-4.1 | $19.06 | ~17 hours | 7.5/10 | ‚ùå Worse than GPT-5 Mini |
| Claude 3.5 Haiku | $34.38 | ~21 hours | 8.2/10 | ‚ùå Too expensive |

**Note:** GPT-5 Nano (current baseline) would cost ~$129 via normal API, or ~$0.13 with batch API (98% discount). However, quality was poor in previous testing.

## Sample Outputs Comparison

### Motion Analysis - Same Input

**Grok 4 Fast (7.5/10):**
```json
{
  "scores": { "concrete_proposals": 4, "cost_analysis": 1, "specific_goals": 2, "legal_text": 3, "implementation": 2 },
  "overall_substantiality_score": 2,
  "category": "empty",
  "assessment": "This motion is weak due to its extreme brevity and lack of detail. It proposes a single, vague idea for an investigation into regulations for deformation zones on cargo bikes but provides no elaboration, evidence, or specifics, rendering it insubstantial and more of a placeholder than a robust policy suggestion."
}
```

**Gemini 2.5 Flash (9/10):**
```json
{
  "scores": { "concrete_proposals": 4, "cost_analysis": 1, "specific_goals": 2, "legal_text": 1, "implementation": 2 },
  "overall_substantiality_score": 2.0,
  "category": "empty",
  "assessment": "This motion is a classic example of a 'tillk√§nnagivande' motion, where the Riksdag requests the government to investigate a specific matter. Its strength lies in identifying an emerging public safety concern related to the increasing use of cargo bikes and pinpointing a specific technical area (deformation zones) for potential regulation. This demonstrates awareness of contemporary societal developments. However, its substantiality as a legislative proposal is extremely limited..."
}
```

**Key Difference:** Gemini provides deeper context ("tillk√§nnagivande motion") and societal awareness, but Grok captures the essence in half the tokens.

## Conclusion

**Grok 4 Fast is the clear winner** for this use case:
- **10√ó cheaper** than Claude 3.5 Haiku
- **5√ó faster** than GPT-5 Mini
- **Acceptable quality** (7.7/10) for large-scale automated analysis
- **Reliable JSON formatting**

For critical analyses or final reports, consider:
- Using Gemini 2.5 Flash for higher quality at 2.6√ó cost
- Manual review of Grok outputs by human analysts
- Hybrid approach: Grok for bulk, Gemini for high-profile politicians

The $31 saved (vs Claude) can fund significant human analyst review time.
